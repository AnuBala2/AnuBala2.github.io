                <h3>Starry Night</h3>
                <img src="images/Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" alt="Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh">
                <p>Starry Night is one of van Gogh's most famous works, painted in 1889. The painting was created while van Gogh was in the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint Rémy-de-Provence, France, where he had admitted himself for his mental health issues. It depicts a swirling night sky over a quiet village, showcasing his unique use of colour and texture. The bold, dynamic brushstrokes and vivid colours create a sense of movement, drawing viewers into a dream-like landscape. "Starry Night" evokes a profound sense of awe and introspection. The swirling patterns of the sky and the intense, vibrant colours draw the viewer into a dream-like state. The painting feels like an emotional and spiritual exploration of van Gogh’s inner world, capturing both his sense of wonder and his struggle with mental turmoil.

                    For me, "Starry Night" is a powerful reminder of the beauty and chaos that coexist in our lives. The contrast between the tumultuous sky and the peaceful village below prompts reflection on how we navigate our own internal and external worlds. It reminds us that even in moments of personal struggle, there can be profound beauty and creativity.</p>
